## Call Centre Trends Analysis Dashboard

The First task was to do dashboard development on Call Centre trends that reflects all necessary KPIs and metrics which would give them transparency and insights to it.

Main KPIs include:

✅Overall customer satisfaction 

✅Overall calls answered/unanswered 

✅Call handling time 

✅Average speed of answer 

✅Agent's performance quadrant

⚡Key Insights on Overview:

📌 The call center received a total of 5000 calls between January and March, out of which 4054 calls were answered

📌 The average speed of answer was 67.85 seconds whereas the overall customer satisfaction rating was 3.41

📌The call center experienced its highest call volume during 5:00-6:00 PM timeframe daily, and similarly, this period represented the peak call volume on a monthly basis in January

⚡Key Insights on Agent's Performance:

📌 The percentage of answered calls for all agents ranged from 79.15% to 82.62%

📌 The percentage of resolved calls across all agents ranged from 71.41% to 74.41%. Dan and Joe were the most proficient agents in terms of resolving calls across all topics and Diane has to improve in this field

📌 Payment-related and technical support topics had the highest number of unresolved calls, highlighting the need for improvement in these specific areas

📑 Areas of Improvement:

The dashboard provides valuable insights into the call center’s performance and can be used to identify areas for improvement. For instance, the high call abandonment rate suggests that there may be a need to improve the call center’s customer service. The dashboard can also be used to track the performance of individual agents and identify those who are excelling or who need additional training.

## Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

As part of my second assignment at PwC’s virtual case experience program, I completed a Power BI project on customer retention. I designed a dashboard for the retention manager that displayed the key performance indicators related to customer loyalty and retention. I also conducted an analysis to identify trends and patterns that could help the company improve its customer retention rates.

Main KPIs includes:

✅ Churn %

✅ Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

✅ Recurring Revenue (RR)

📍 Quick Insights

📌 The analysis of customer churn by gender shows that females have slightly more churn rate than males, with a churn rate of 26.92% versus 26.16%.

📌 Dependents and partners are important factors influencing customer churn. Customers who do not have dependents or partners tend to leave the service more often, with a churn rate of 31.28% and 32.96%, respectively.

📌 Customers who have a month-to-month contract are more likely to leave the service, with a churn rate of 42.71%. Customers who have a one-year or a two-year contract are less likely to leave, with churn rates of 11.71% and 2.83%, respectively.

## Diversity & Inclusion Analysis Dashboard

📌 Customers who use fiber optic internet service tend to leave the service more than customers who use DSL internet service. Additionally, customers who do not have streaming and additional services are more likely to churn.
